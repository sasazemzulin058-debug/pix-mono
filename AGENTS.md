## Product Design Philosophy

Pix is a **transparent, token-efficient, model-flexible** Pi distro. These are product constraints, not optional preferences. Apply them when designing, implementing, or reviewing every feature.

### 1. Minimize token use

- Keep the baseline system prompt and recurring tool schemas small.
- Load skills, instructions, model catalogs, and volatile metadata only on demand.
- Prefer targeted reads, bounded previews, compact structured results, and edit formats that reduce retries.
- Inject prompts only when the current task needs them; avoid passive or always-on context.
- UI collapse may reduce visual clutter, but the complete result must remain expandable and available to the user and agent.
- Measure token savings where possible. Do not make unverified efficiency claims.
- Avoid always-on advisors, reviewers, background loops, verbose orchestration transcripts, and giant all-purpose tool schemas.

### 2. Preserve strong model flexibility

- The user or calling agent chooses the model for each task.
- Pix may display benchmark scores, context size, price, capabilities, and recommendations, but must not silently pin or route to a model/provider.
- Subagents inherit the parent model when omitted or use the caller's explicit `model`; an agent type/persona must not override that choice.
- Any fallback or model change must be visible and report the reason, previous model, replacement model, and relevant cost/capability difference.
- Prefer provider-neutral interfaces and avoid features that create provider lock-in.

### 3. Keep agent behavior visible

- Every meaningful read, command, edit, delegation, approval, retry, and result must appear in the transcript or live UI.
- Show subagent identity, selected model, scope, current activity, token/cost information when available, and final output.
- Show file changes as inspectable diffs and findings with paths/evidence.
- Users must be able to inspect, expand, steer, stop, approve, reject, or undo work where the operation permits it.
- Never discard details merely because a card is collapsed; collapsing is presentation, not concealment.
- Memory, if added, must be explicit and auditable: visible retain/recall operations, provenance, injected-token estimate, and list/edit/delete controls.

### 4. Prefer composability over magic

- Build complex behavior from ordinary, visible tools and subagents.
- Convenience UI may prepare, organize, or summarize a workflow, but must not conceal its plan, model routing, tool calls, retries, edits, or review steps.
- Avoid any opaque high-level command, shortcut, trigger, or mode that silently launches planning, routing, tool use, retries, edits, delegation, or background automation. A `/goal`-style command or magic word is only one example of this broader anti-pattern.
- Reviews must be explicitly invoked and show reviewer models, scopes, token use, evidence, deduplication, and verdict construction; do not run an always-on reviewer by default.

### Feature review checklist

Before accepting a feature, answer:

1. Does it reduce or unnecessarily add baseline/context/output tokens?
2. Can the user choose the model and provider without a hidden override?
3. Can the user see what ran, why it ran, what it read or changed, and what it cost?
4. Can the user inspect, steer, stop, approve, reject, or undo it where applicable?
5. Is it composed from visible primitives rather than opaque automation?
6. Is a sensitive, expensive, or setup-heavy capability opt-in instead of bundled by default?

Product promise: **No hidden intent. No silent routing. No blind automation.**

## Development

```bash
bun install                # install deps
bun run dev:link           # symlink into Pi (restart Pi after)
bun run dev:unlink         # restore npm copies
bun run check              # biome lint + format
bun run check:fix          # auto-fix
bun run typecheck          # tsc --noEmit
bun test                   # unit tests
```

---

## Commits

Format: `type(scope): short description` — scope = package name, e.g. `fix(pix-core): ...`

Types: **feat** (new capability) · **fix** (bug fix) · **refactor** (no behavior change) · **chore** (deps/config/tooling) · **docs** (documentation)

---

## CI / CD

**CI** runs on every push to `main` and PRs: biome ci → tsc → bun test.

**CD** is triggered by a release tag (`release-YYYYMMDD-HHMM`), never by direct push.

```bash
# Bump version(s), commit, push, then:
TAG="release-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)" && git tag "$TAG" && git push origin "$TAG"
```

The publish workflow re-runs CI, checks each `name@version` against npm, publishes only new versions (idempotent, OIDC trusted publishing — no NPM_TOKEN needed). Dry-run locally: `bun run publish:dry`.

### Agent runbook — "publish"

"publish" (alone) means: run this exact sequence, no re-asking which packages.

1. **Gate** — `bun run check && bun run typecheck && bun test`. Red → STOP.
2. **Confirm bumps** — changed packages must have version ahead of npm. Unbumped → that package silently ships nothing (no error). Semver: `feat`→minor, `fix`/`perf`→patch, breaking→major.
3. **Commit + push** — confirm via `ask_user` first (shared-state push).
4. **Dry-run** — `bun run publish:dry` — note the exact `name@version` list.
5. **Confirm publish** — `ask_user` with the exact list. Prior approval never carries forward.
6. **Tag + push** — creates the release tag, triggers the Publish workflow.
7. **Verify GitHub Actions** — use `gh run list` to find the CI run for the tagged SHA, then `gh run watch <run-id> --exit-status`. After CI succeeds, find and watch the resulting Publish run. Confirm its log reports every expected `name@version` as published and ends with `0 failed`; report the Publish workflow URL and exact published versions. Red → STOP and report the failing step/log — never claim the release succeeded from the tag push alone.

---

## Package Independence

- **Three sanctioned shared layers:** `pix-data` (data + config), `pix-pretty` (rendering), `pix-core` (aggregator). Beyond these, keep packages self-contained.
- Prefer duplicating small utilities over adding a cross-package dep.
- Each package owns its own version — bump only what changed.
- Pi host is always a `peerDependency`, never a direct dep.
- Third-party deps go in the package that needs them, not hoisted to root.

---

## Dependency Versioning

**All `@xynogen/` deps must use caret ranges (`^x.y.z`).** Never `workspace:*` or bare `"*"` — these break npm publish and end-user installs.

- Set range to `^<current version>` of the target package.
- After a **minor bump** of a shared 0.x package, update the caret range in **all consumers** (e.g. `pix-data` 0.3→0.4 means `"^0.3.0"` → `"^0.4.0"` everywhere). Patch bumps within the same minor need no consumer edits (`^0.3.0` already matches `0.3.1`). Consumers whose dep range changed also need a patch bump + republish.
- `publish-all.ts` aborts if `workspace:` ranges survive.
- CI enforces via `scripts/deps.test.ts`: no `workspace:`, no bare `*`, all `@xynogen/` deps use `^`.

---

## Icon Catalog

**Never hardcode Nerd Font glyph codepoints** (terminals without Nerd Fonts render them as tofu). Use the semantic catalog in `pix-pretty`:

```ts
import { icon } from "@xynogen/pix-pretty/icon-catalog";
icon("cwd")           // resolves glyph for active mode (nerd/unicode/ascii)
```

- Keys are semantic roles (`"model"`, `"cwd"`, `"paste.image"`), never glyph names.
- `PRETTY_ICONS` env seeds default; `/pix` settings command switches live (persisted to `~/.pi/agent/pix.json`).
- New icons → add to `CATALOG` in `packages/pix-pretty/src/icon-catalog.ts` with all three variants.

---

## Unified Config — `~/.pi/agent/pix.json`

Auto-created with defaults on first session. Sections:

| Section | Consumers |
|---|---|
| `collapse` | pix-bash, pix-read, pix-grep, pix-edit, pix-write, pix-find, pix-ls, pix-todo |
| `pretty` | pix-pretty (theme, icons, preview, diff colors) |
| `optimizer` | pix-optimizer (caveman/rtk/toon/ponytail state) |
| `gate` | pix-gate (rules, auto-approve patterns) |

Loader: `@xynogen/pix-data/pix-config` · Collapse: `@xynogen/pix-data/collapse`. Full schema in `packages/pix-data/README.md`.

---

## Key Rules

- **Always run `bun run check` + `bun run typecheck` before committing** — CI will fail otherwise.
- **Never tag without bumping versions** — publish skips already-published versions.
- **Patch bumps only by default.** Minor/major require explicit user approval.
- **No `/toolbox` in agent-facing text** — it's a user slash command, not model-callable.
- Scripts are idempotent. Shared tsconfig: `tsconfig.base.json` — each package extends it.
- New packages: keep zero-dep on other `pix-*` packages if at all possible.
